"""
Timing/overlap features at the serviceâ†’service edge level.

Definitions per event:
- lag_ns = down_start_ns - up_end_ns  (time gap from upstream completion to downstream start)
- overlap = 1 if down_start_ns < up_end_ns else 0  (downstream starts before upstream ends)

Aggregates per edge:
- median_lag_ns, p_overlap (fraction of events with overlap), p_nonneg_lag (share with lag >= 0)

Rationale:
- Synchronous RPC typically shows substantial overlap (client active while server runs).
- Async messaging typically shows down_start >= up_end (little/no overlap; often positive lag).
